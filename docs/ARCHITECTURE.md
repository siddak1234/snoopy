# Snoopy website architecture

Status: **Round 5 web boundary implemented for incremental merge; Round 5 exit
gates remain open**

Snoopy is the Autom8x web client and same-origin BFF surface. The backend Edge
API owns identity, tenancy, product data, provider credentials, artifacts,
entitlements, execution, and their secrets.

## Request boundary

```text
browser ──same origin──> /api/platform/v1/* ──> Edge API ──> owning services
```

`BACKEND_API_ORIGIN` is the website's only build/runtime setting. Next bakes the
same-origin rewrite into the production build; the origin is never exposed as a
browser configuration value. Server components, actions, and proxy session
lookups forward only the browser's host-only session cookies to Edge.

## Rules enforced in this repository

- Browser calls use `lib/platform-api.ts`; server calls use
  `lib/platform-server.ts`; proxy session rotation uses `lib/platform-proxy.ts`.
- Public response types are generated from the three published OpenAPI inputs.
  A web change cannot invent a request, response, cursor interpretation, billing
  flow, invite flow, or OAuth-provider policy.
- No Prisma, direct database, Supabase SDK, object-store SDK, browser secret,
  manual password login, or provider credential belongs here.
- Tenancy state comes from typed Edge responses. Mutations have unique
  idempotency keys, while a user retry reuses its one explicit intent key.

## Identity and connections

Login is backend-mediated OAuth. The website renders only the provider policy
published by Edge; OAuth client registration, redirect allowlists, PKCE, token
exchange, refresh, and provider secrets stay backend-managed. Connector OAuth
is distinct from login identity and follows the public connection-provider
contract.

## Container and operations

The Docker image uses Next standalone output and the non-root `nextjs` user.
`compose.yml` joins the backend's external `autom8x_default` network and uses
the internal Edge address `http://api:8080`. The web process exposes liveness at
`GET /api/health`; `GET /api/ready` reflects Edge readiness.

Infrastructure resource allocation and production secret management are
deployment concerns. This repository deliberately proves the interfaces with
typed, credential-free fixtures rather than storing local resource settings.

Merging the web implementation does not close Round 5. The exact deferred
contract, live-observation, accessibility, visual, and governance work is
recorded in the Round 5 audit. Formal Round 6 work requires the backend-owned
master-plan status to authorize that sequencing; this repository cannot make
that governance edit.

## Verification

Run the commands in the README. The fixture browser audit provides disposable
HTTPS, an authenticated cookie-only session, and deterministic public Edge
responses; it is not a substitute for a real non-production OAuth-provider
observation when that environment is provisioned.
